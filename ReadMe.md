#MAT201B Final Project
###Fall 2015,   Chang HE (Hilda)

![Plasma pamplet](./Plasma_pamplet.pdf)

##Description:
The program randomly generates lightning which is the simulation of plasma and shoots the nucleus on its surface, and the nucleus will bulge in direction of the lightning to absorb the plasma. 
Audience can interact with Plasma to generate new lightning by pointing the direction they want and pinch using PhaseSpace. Thereâ€™s also electric sound when every plasma is generated.

##Interaction:
1. you can use PhaseSpace
2. Press "+" key to accelerate the speed of lightnings 
3. Press "-" key tp slpow down the speed of lightnings

##Files and How to run them##
1. Go to student/chang.he/fp  *(fp stands for final project)*
2. Run simulator_4.cpp
3. Run render\_allosphere\_4.cpp

Although there are many files in my fp repository, only **4** of them are the final version for grading and presentation. They are:

1. **simulator_4.cpp**
2. **render\_allosphere\_4.cpp** (there is no backslash in file name)
3. **common_4.hpp**
4. **phasespace_interaction.hpp**


##Future Developments:
1. Snowflake effect at the starting point of the lightning
2. Volume rendering 
3. 3D lighting algorithms
4. GPU threshold in allo_render
5. Spatial sound
